# SyncUS

Now listen, control music together with your friends.

## 💡Inspiration

Ever since the pandemic has hit we humans have drifted apart from the community, thus we bring you our hack SyncUS, your one stop to groove into to the world of music together with your friends to escape the monotony of everyday life.


## 🧩What it does

SyncUS allows users to

• Listen to Music : Users can listen to music, have control over what they play. They can groove into music with the community.

• Chat with community : Users can chat with people/ friends around the globe about nothing to everything, they can also see who all are connected to the chat. The song played by any member gets played for everyone joined in the chat.


## 🛠 How we built it
We used spotify-api to build our back-end server and sockit.io for chat box implementation. And for the frontend, we used Reactjs.

## 🎯Challenges we ran into 

In integrating the front-end with the backend, we ran into several issues, but all got resolved. We also had to research on finding appropriate python libraries for using spotify's api and for connecting spotify to the chat.

## 🏆Accomplishments that we're proud of

Completed the project as per the plan. We are proud of creating a full-fledged application, backend server with proper documentation, frontend in such a little time.

## 📖What we learned

 Learned about new Spotify API. Used new python libraries like spotipy.


## ⛳️What's next for Sync Us
Providing users with a more personalized dashboard along with further adding music recommendations.
